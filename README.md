This is a multi-threaded simulation of the MBTA. In this simulation, passengers would ride trains between different stations, boarding and deboarding according to info provided in the input file. The simulation also generates a log showing the movements between passengers and trains, for example:
  
  "Passenger Alice boards red at Harvard"
  "Passenger Tom deboards green at Boylston"
